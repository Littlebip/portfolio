    <p>Hey there! 👋 My name is Lucile Grandjean, and I'm a creation-driven 🎨, high-energy 🏋️‍♀️ full-stack developer 💻 with a hands-on approach to problem-solving 🔧 and an unending thirst for knowledge 📖.

      I am currently based in the sunny South of France 🌄 where I just graduated 🎓 from Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp 🪖. Before that, I was on the front-line of early-education in China🧋, helping my students to make the best of starts when I was a teacher, but also finding diverse ways to get their interest 🦈👀.

      When I'm not immersed in the world of technology 💻, you can find me hiking, running 🏃‍♀️ or doing other various outdoor sports 🏊‍♀️🚵‍♀️🧗‍♀️🪂. Apart from that, I love a good read 📖 and gardening 🥕.

      I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on my website 🌐 or connect with me on LinkedIn 👥. Feel free to reach out to me directly at grandjean.lucile@hotmail.fr 📧. Let's connect and explore exciting possibilities together! 🚀</p>

    <h2 id="projects">Here is what kept me busy lately:</h2>
    <a href="https://photobuddies.me">PhotoBuddies</a>
    <p>PhotoBuddies is a Rails app prototype. It help building local photography communities. I designed and developped this project for two weeks as a team of 4 during the final weeks of Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp.</p>
