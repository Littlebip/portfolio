        My name is <strong>Lucile Grandjean</strong>, and I'm a creation-driven 🎨, high-energy 🏋️‍♀️

        I am currently based in the sunny South of France 🌄 where I just graduated 🎓 from <strong>Le Wagon Web
        Development bootcamp</strong> 🪖. Before that, I was on the front-line of <strong>early-education
        in China</strong>🧋, helping my students to make the best of starts when I was a teacher, but also
        finding diverse ways to <a href="https://youtu.be/i2andEk5oj4" target="_blank"><strong>get their
        interest</strong> <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i>👀</a>. When I'm not immersed in the world
        of technology 💻, you can find me hiking, running 🏃‍♀️ or doing other various outdoor sports
         🏊‍♀️🚵‍♀️🧗‍♀️🪂. Apart from that, I love creating new recipes 🍲 and gardening 🥕.

              PhotoBuddies is a <strong>Rails app prototype</strong> that helps photographers get in
              touch with their <strong>local photography community</strong> and share their art.

              I <strong>designed, developed, pushed to production and demoed</strong> this product
              in two weeks as a team of four junior developers as a <strong>final project</strong>
              during my <strong>Web Development Bootcamp</strong> at Le Wagon. This project taught me a
              lot in terms of <strong>teamwork, communication skills and organization</strong>.
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              It was very exciting to work on this project <strong>from A to Z</strong>, and being
              able to deliver after only two weeks made our team very proud.
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              After the end of the bootcamp, I have kept working on the project, namely getting rid of <strong>n + 1
              relations</strong>, adding some <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>refactoring</strong> the code to make it cleaner.

              This was an intermediary project during my <strong>Web Development Bootcamp</strong>
              at Le Wagon. I worked during <strong>one week as a team of four</strong> junior developers on this project.
              Being able to build and host a functional yet simple website was a <strong>very practical experience</strong>
              and it made me want to build more and better in the future!

              I am very proud to present my latest project which is still ...cooking 🔥🔥🔥It is a
              <strong>Rails web app</strong> that helps people organizing their meals.
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              This project started from a very personal pain: I love to cook, but <strong>designing meal
              plans can take a lot of time</strong>: making sure that each meal is <strong>varied, nutritious
              </strong>and cooked with <strong>seasonal</strong> ingredients... but also fits the <strong>likings
              </strong>and <strong>allergies</strong> of the people you live with can be a pain in the back.
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              So this is what <strong>OnMangeKoi</strong> (in French: What are we eating?) does for you: it <strong>
              designs your meal plans</strong> according to your criteria, but also provides you with the
              corresponding <strong>recipes</strong> AND also <strong>makes your shopping list</strong> for you!
              The web app is <strong>still in design</strong> right now, and I will be very excited to see it
              go live and use it myself!
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              As my French-only mom asked for a version she could use, I am planning to create <strong>two versions</strong>:
              one in English using a <strong>RESTful API</strong> for recipes and ingredients, and another one
              in French using my mom's personal stack of recipes 😁
              <br />
              <span class="indent">___</span>
              Both versions should make me practice a lot of varied developing skills.
